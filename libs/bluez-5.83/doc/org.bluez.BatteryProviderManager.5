.TH "ORG.BLUEZ.BATTERYPROVIDERMANAGER" "5" "October 2023" "BlueZ" "Linux System Administration"
.SH NAME
org.bluez.BatteryProviderManager \- BlueZ D-Bus BatteryProviderManager API documentation
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
A battery provider starts by registering itself as a battery provider with the
\fBRegisterBatteryProvider()\fP method passing an object path as the provider ID.
Then, it can start exposing \fBorg.bluez.BatteryProvider(5)\fP objects having the
path starting with the given provider ID. It can also remove objects at any
time.
The objects and their properties exposed by battery providers will be reflected
on \fBorg.bluez.Battery(5)\fP interface.
.sp
\fBbluetoothd(8)\fP will stop monitoring these exposed and removed objects after
UnregisterBatteryProvider is called for that provider ID.
