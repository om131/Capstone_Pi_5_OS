.SS Methods
.SS void Connect()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Connects all profiles the remote device supports that can be connected
to and have been flagged as auto\-connectable. If only subset of profiles
is already connected it will try to connect currently disconnected ones.
.sp
If at least one profile was connected successfully this method will
indicate success.
.sp
For dual\-mode devices only one bearer is connected at time, the
conditions are in the following order:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Connect the disconnected bearer if already connected.
.UNINDENT
.sp
2. Connect first the bonded bearer. If no bearers are bonded or both
are skip and check latest seen bearer.
.sp
3. Connect last seen bearer, in case the timestamps are the same BR/EDR
takes precedence, or in case \fBPreferredBearer\fP has been set to a
specific bearer then that is used instead.

.SS void Disconnect()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Disconnects all connected profiles and then terminates low\-level ACL
connection.
.sp
ACL connection will be terminated even if some profiles were not
disconnected properly e.g. due to misbehaving device.
.sp
This method can be also used to cancel a preceding Connect call before
a reply to it has been received.
.sp
For non\-trusted devices connected over LE bearer calling this method
will disable incoming connections until Connect method is called again.

.INDENT 3.5
Disconnects a specific profile of this device. The profile needs to be
registered client profile.
.sp
There is no connection tracking for a profile, so as long as the
profile is registered this will always succeed.

.SS void Pair()
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Connects to the remote device and initiate pairing procedure then
proceed with service discovery.
.sp
If the application has registered its own agent, then that specific
agent will be used. Otherwise it will use the default agent.
.sp
Only for applications like a pairing wizard it would make sense to have
its own agent. In almost all other cases the default agent will handle
this just fine.
.sp
In case there is no application agent and also no default agent present,
this method will fail.

.SS array{array{byte}} GetServiceRecords() [experimental]
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Returns all currently known BR/EDR service records for the device. Each
individual byte array represents a raw SDP record, as defined by the
Bluetooth Service Discovery Protocol specification.
.sp
This method is intended to be only used by compatibility layers like
Wine, that need to provide access to raw SDP records to support foreign
Bluetooth APIs. General applications should instead use the Profile API
for services\-related functionality.

.SS Signals
.SS void Disconnected(string reason, string message)
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
This signal is launched when a device is disconnected, with the reason
of the disconnection.
.sp
This could be used by client application, depending on internal policy,
to try to reconnect to the device in case of timeout or unknown
disconnection, or to try to connect to another device.
.sp
Possible reasons:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B org.bluez.Reason.Unknown
.TP
.B org.bluez.Reason.Timeout
Connection timeout.
.sp
The link supervision timeout has expired for a connection or the
synchronization timeout has expired for a broadcast.
.TP
.B org.bluez.Reason.Local
Connection terminated by local host.
.sp
The local device terminated the connection, terminated
synchronization with a broadcaster, or terminated broadcasting
packets.
.TP
.B org.bluez.Reason.Remote
Connection terminated by remote host.
.sp
This disconnection can be due to:
\- the user on the remote device either terminated the connection
or stopped broadcasting packets,
\- the remote device terminated the connection because of low
resources,
\- the remote device terminated the connection because the device
is about to power off.
.TP
.B org.bluez.Reason.Authentication
Connection terminated due to an authentication failure.
.TP
.B org.bluez.Reason.Suspend
Connection terminated by local host for suspend.
