.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Retrieves an entire Phonebook Object store from remote device, and
stores it in a local file.
.sp
If an empty target file is given, a name will be automatically
calculated for the temporary file.

The returned path represents the newly created transfer, which should be
used to find out if the content has been successfully transferred or if
the operation fails.
.sp
The properties of this transfer are also returned along with the object
path, to avoid a call to GetProperties, see
\fBorg.bluez.obex.Transfer(5)\fP for the possible list of properties.
