.TH "BLUETOOTHCTL-TRANSPORT" "1" "November 2022" "BlueZ" "Linux System Administration"
.SH NAME
bluetoothctl-transport \- Media Transport Submenu
.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBbluetoothctl\fP [\-\-options] [transport.commands]
.SH MEDIA TRANSPORT COMMANDS
.SS list
.sp
List available transports.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Usage
\fB> list\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS show
.sp
Show transport information.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Usage
\fB> show [transport]\fP
.UNINDENT
.SS acquire
.sp
Acquire transport.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Usage
\fB> acquire <transport> [transport1...]\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note:
.sp
If running the setup with an audio server that has LE Audio support (such as PipeWire) it will
automatically acquire transports according to the configured roles.
.SS select
.sp
Select transport. For transports created on a Broadcast Sink device only. This moves
the transport to the \(dqbroadcasting\(dq state, pending acquire.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Usage
\fB> select <transport> [transport1...]\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note:
.sp
If the select command receives a list of transports, they will first be linked using the
\(dqLinks\(dq MediaTransport property. They will then be selected one by one, by calling
the \(dqSelect\(dq MediaTransport method. After the first transport is acquired, the Broadcast
Sink will create fds for the associated stream and all its links. Each link can then be
acquired one by one, setting the fd for the transport and starting to receive audio.
.sp
The select command does not require a local endpoint to be registered beforehand. This is
because if the setup runs with an audio server that has LE Audio support (such as PipeWire),
the audio server is the one to register endpoints and the transports are created as a result.
Once a transport is selected, the audio server will automatically acquire.
.SS unselect
.sp
Unselect transport. For transports created on a Broadcast Sink device only. This moves
the transport to the \(dqidle\(dq state, pending release by the audio server. If the transport
was acquired by bluetoothctl it can be released straight away, without having to be
unselected.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B Usage
\fB> unselect <transport> [transport1...]\fP
.UNINDENT
.sp
Note:
If running the setup with an audio server that has LE Audio support (such as PipeWire), it will
prompt it to automatically release the transport.
.SS release
.sp
